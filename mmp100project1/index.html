           <h2> What makes a good beach day?

                    The beach is more fun with toys! Kids and adults alike enjoy beach floats, body boards, sand pails, and beach games. If you have toddlers and preschoolers, bring a small inflatable pool to fill with sea water.

                <h3> Now let's see how joe and his family spend their sunday on the beach  </h3>
                First things first i along with my  dad and mom got ready for beach . We  packed our picnic stuff some snacks , drinks , sunscreen , umberella , portable chairs and most importantly swimsuits .
                The beach was surrounded by dense trees and it was very clean. My mother sat on the sand under a tree and took out a book to read. My sister and I went to play with the water in the sea. We splashed water on each other and enjoyed the sea waves when they made us go up and down. After some time, we came back. Then I and my sister made a sandcastle. I also collected shells on the beach and we decorated the castle with them.

                We bought fruits on the beach and also drank coconut water after that. When it was evening, we saw the setting sun. It looked like the sun was going inside the sea. We took a lot of pictures of this scene.
