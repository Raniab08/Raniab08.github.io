        <h1>Agent Claire got a lead </h1>

        <p>It was a friday night Claire was signing off from her office suddenly she got a call from the highway department that the car with an unregistered number plate just passed the route which leads to an abandoned area . 
        and beacuse that area was under Claire's suspect . She already had an idea that the smugglers she is after had a secret spot where they hide their stuff . 
        She called the headquaters and informed them about this activity and they prepared for backup . The area was surrounded by officers but claire along with her fellow was leading . They both got there it was night time they were in the forest .
